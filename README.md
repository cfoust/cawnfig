> Configuration with a funny pronunciation.

This repository contains everything necessary to install and use my
development environment. It's pretty extra, so I don't really
recommend doing that, but hey, you might find some useful things
here.

## vim

A minimal set of plugins and configuration for modern software
development. Nothing too crazy here.

## tmux

I wrote a plugin for `tmux` called
[`tmux-oakthree`](https://github.com/cfoust/tmux-oakthree) that
makes `tmux` into its own little project-focused window manager.
It's neat, give it a try.

## i3

I use [`i3-gaps`](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) because
otherwise I found my life was pretty boring.
